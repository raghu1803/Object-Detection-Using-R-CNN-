This repository demonstrates how to perform object detection using a pretrained Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet-50 backbone, provided by the PyTorch torchvision library. The model is used to detect objects in an image and output bounding boxes along with labels from the COCO dataset. The image is processed, predictions are made, and the results are visualized by drawing bounding boxes and labeling objects with their corresponding names.

The example image is downloaded from the COCO dataset, and only objects with a confidence score above a defined threshold are shown. OpenCV is used for drawing the bounding boxes and class names directly onto the image, which is then displayed.

This project is ideal for understanding how to apply pre-trained object detection models and visualize results in Python using PyTorch and OpenCV.
